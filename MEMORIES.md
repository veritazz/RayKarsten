# Memory requirements

This is a loose list of items and their memory requirements that are planned
for the game.
The size is more fictive at the moment. It will need to be optimized to fit for
the Arduboy.

Item             | Size    | Count | Bytes
-----------------|---------|-------|-------
Wall texture     | 64x64px | ?     | ?x512
Enemy sprite     | 64x32px | ?x4   | ?x1024
Collectable item | 32x32   | ?     | ?x128
